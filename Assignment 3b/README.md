## Programming Assignment Directions

In this assignment you are to create a table view app which displays data on vinyl record albums.  The assignment will have a detail view for each album, and will use persistent storage to keep track of the data.  For the main view, a list of albums, Define a custom cell for each album that contains

**Album title, bold and larger font**

**Artist (e.g. The Beatles),**

 

**When an album is selected, the app should transition to a detail view for that album which displays at the top the album title and artist, but also displays**

  - year of release
  - record label
  - thumbnail of cover art (optional)
  - Listing of tracks in a table view, with for each track, the track number, track name (song title or movement name), length, and composer  (optional)
 
**There should be a way to edit an album's data in the detail view. There should be a way to select an album to delete it, from the main list. Also a way to add a new album, which would go to a new, editable detail view.** 

**Put in some data for at least 10 albums.**
