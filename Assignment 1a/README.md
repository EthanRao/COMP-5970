# Programming Assignment 1a

## Instructions

The first project does not require you to write a single line of code. We are really testing that you can work the SDK and that the entire tool chain is functioning correctly for you.  Your task is to evelop a single-view iOS application for iOS, and build for an iPhone simulator.   In the view there should be a label, centered vertically and horizontally, with the text centered in the label space as well. The text should say “The first iPhone app made by John Doe” where you replace John Doe with your own name. If you don’t use your own name, I don’t know you didn’t  just copy it from somewhere else, so the penalty for not having it say your own name is pretty severe.

## Deliverables

Zip (control-click and compress) the project directory containing all the files for your Xcode project, and submit that via file upload in Canvas by the due date.
