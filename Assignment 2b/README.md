We will revisit the loan calculator assignment, with different layouts to support portrait mode (wC hR), landscape mode on smaller iPhones (wC hC),  in both orientations.  For the wC hR size class (iPhone portrait), your layout should look like:

You should use the technique covered in lectures rather than the book (that is, a single view with one instance of each text field and button, rather than different ones for the different layouts. This will make getting the app to actually work a lot easier, and wonâ€™t require the use of outlet collections.
